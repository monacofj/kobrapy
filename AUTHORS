 KobraPy is an open education resource teaching open-source development
 practices and tools for newcomers. It was originally written by
 Dr. Monaco F. J. for the undergraduate course on Open Source Systems
 taught to Computer Sciences and Engineering students at the University
 of Sao Paulo.

 Acknowledgments are due to the support from FOSS Research and Education
 Program of the Open Source Competence Center ICMC-USP, as well to all
 students and research colleagues who have provided valuable feedback.

 If you ever check out this project in any educational program, the author
 would love to hear from you (monaco@usp.br)."
