 ==============================

 KhobraPy is intended as programming exercise.

 It consists in a very simple version of the classical 80s' arcade snake game
 written in Python, that is provided as an initial codebase  that should be 
 further extended by the learner. It was originally created as an educational
 resource to teach open-source development practices, tools and project
 management methodologies to graduate computer sciences students.

 The practice consists in

 a) fixing the listed known issues (bugs and requested features);
   
 b) improving the game by adding some awesome new features.

 KhobraPy is free software and can be distributed under the GNU General Public
 License vr.3 or any later version, as detailed in the included file `COPYING`.

 _If you ever use this project to implement any programming course or instruction
  program, the author would be glad if let him know._
